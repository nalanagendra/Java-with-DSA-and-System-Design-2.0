1. What is statically typed and dynamically typed Programming Language?
Answer: While creating the variable some languages must know the type of variable during the compile
time and type must be explicitly mentioned. These type of languages are known as statically typed 
languages. The type of variables will be determined by the compiler during run time based on the 
usage, such type of languages are known as dynamically typed languages.

2. What is the variable in Java?
Answer: Variables are the containers to store data/information during the life cycle of a program.

3. How to assign a value to a variable?
Answer: 1. Declare the variable with correct type and simoultaneously assign the variable.
        var_type varName = value;

4. What are primitive datatypes in Java?
Answer: Primitive datatypes are simple datatypes which hold basic data. These datatypes has only value 
but no methods. Eg: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean.

5. What are identifiers in Java?
Answer: Identifier is the name given to a package, class, interface, method or variable.

6. List the Operators in Java.
Answer: 
1. Arithmetic operators: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Remainder(%).
2. Logical Operator: AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!).
3. Unary operators: increment(++), decrement(--).
4. Assignment Operator: assign(=).
5. Relational Operator: Lessthan(<), greaterThan(>), LessThanorEqual(<=), GreaterThanorEqual(>=),
    notEqual(!=), equal(==).

7. Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples.
Answer: 
Increment Operator: Increment operators are unary operators which increase the current value of operand 
by one. There are two types of increment operators 
1. Pre-increment operator: Eg: 
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = ++num1;
    here firstly the value of num1 is incremented and then incremented value is assigned to num2.
    both the values of num1 and num2 will be 11 here.

2. Post-increment operator: 
Eg: int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = num1++;
    here fistly the value of num1 is assigned to num2 and then num1 is incremented. At the end the value
    of num1 us 11 and value of num2 is 10.

Decrement Operator: Decrement operators are unary operators which decrease the current value of 
operands by one. There are two types of decrement operators.
1. Pre-decrement operator: 
eg: int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = --num1;
    here fistly the value of num1 will be decremented and then assigned to num2. So at the end values 
    of both num1 and num2 will be 9.

2. Post decrement operator: 
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = num1--;
    here initially the value of num1 will be assigned to num2. So the value of num2 will be 10, while the value 
    of num1 will be decremented to 9.
