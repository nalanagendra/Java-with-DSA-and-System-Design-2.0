1. What are conditional operators in Java?
Ans: Conditional operators are also known as ternary operators in Java. They are the shorter form of 
writing if-else statements. This operator has three operands. 
Syntax: (condition) ? (statement1) : (statement2);

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans : There are basically three types of operands based on the number of operands:
 1.Unary operator: If there is only one operand in a operator then it is called unary operator.
    eg: Not(!), unary minus(-), increment operator(++), decrement(--).
 2.Binary operator: If there are two operands in a operator then it is called binary operator.
    eg: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), multiplication(*) etc.,
 3.Ternary operator: If there are three operands in an operator then it is called ternary operator.
    eg: ternary operator(condition ? statement1 : statement2).

3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans: Switch case is a multi way branch statement.
     The main use is duplicate case values are not allowed.
     There is a strong type checking for the case variable data type.
     It is more like the if-else-if ladder.
Syntax : 
    switch(statement) {
        case a: {
            statements;
            break;
        } case b: {
            statements;
            break;
        }default: {
            statements;
            break;
        }
    }

4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Ans: So the precedence of operators for arithmetic operation is such that,
    Multiplication(*) and division(/) takes higher precedence than Addition(+) and Subtraction(-).

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans: Conditional operators are the operators as the name suggests conditionally execute the statements
based on the condition. Basically a condition is tested, based on the results from the condition the
statements are executed.
Syntax : 
    if (condition) {
        statements;
    } else {
        statements;
    }
If the conditions are true then statements of the If block are executed, else the statements from else
block will be executed.
It is mainly used to execute certain statements conditionally based on the truthyness of the conditions.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans: The syntax of if-else statement is: 
    Syntax : 
    if (condition) {
        statements;
    } else {
        statements;
    }
Each if or else block can have multiple statements in the block, which will be executed based on the
condition.

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?
Ans: The three types of iterative statemets in Java are:
    For Loop: This is syntactically compact form of loop, which is basically helpful if user already knows 
how many times the loop statements has to run.
 Syntax: for (initialization; condition; update of loop variable) {
    statement;
 }
    While Loop: This loop is used when the user doesn't know how many times the loop body has to run
 Syntax: 
    initialization;
    while(condition) {
        statement;
        update of loop variable;
    }

    do-while loop: This loop is used when user wants the loop to run atleast one time even if the 
condition is not satisfied.
 Syntax:
    initialization;
    do {
        statement;
        updation if loop variable;
    } while(condition);

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans: For loop is mainly used if the number of times the loop body execution is known, do-while loop is 
used if loop has to execute atleast once even if the condition is false.
 The syntax of for loop is compact, while the syntax of do-while loop is not compact.z
 The body of do-while loop will be executed atleast once, while in for loop the body will be executed 
based on the condition.

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Code: 
    public class PrintNumbers {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i ++) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
